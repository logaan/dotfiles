DOTFILES

My configuration files. I'm gradually building these up as I setup my new
machines. I intend to keep them minimal.

Be carefull of the installation script. It uses ln -sf to symlink the files to
the home directory. This will overwrite any files or symlinks you currently
have in your home directory.

Install with:

  rake
